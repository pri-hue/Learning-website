            <p class="sectionSubTag small-text">Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character
                traits. There are many debates about its precise definition, for example, about which aims it tries to
                achieve. A further issue is whether part of the meaning of education is that the change in the student
                is an improvement. Some researchers stress the role of critical thinking to distinguish education from
                indoctrination. These disagreements affect how to identify, measure, and improve forms of education. The
                term can also refer to the mental states and qualities of educated people.
                Additionally, it can mean the
                academic field studying education.There are many types of education. Formal education happens in a
                complex institutional framework, like public schools. Non-formal education is also structured but
                happens outside the formal schooling system. Informal education is unstructured learning through daily
                experiences. Formal and non-formal education are divided into levels They include early childhood
                education, primary education, secondary education, and tertiary education.Other classifications focus on
                the teaching method, like teacher-centered and student-centered education. Forms of education can also
                be distinguished by subject, like science education, language education, and physical education.

            <p class="sectionSubTag small-text">Education in India is primarily managed by the state-run public
                education system, which falls under the command of the government at three levels: central, state and
                local. Under various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and
                Compulsory Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to
                children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of the total number of public schools to private schools in
                India is 10:3.[7]

                Education in India covers different levels and types of learning, such as early childhood education,
                primary education, secondary education, higher education, and vocational education. It varies
                significantly according to different factors, such as location (urban or rural), gender, caste,
                religion, language, and disability.

                Education in India faces many challenges and opportunities, such as improving access and quality,
                reducing disparities and dropouts, increasing enrolment and completion rates, enhancing learning
                outcomes and employability, strengthening governance and accountability, promoting innovation and
                technology, and addressing the impact of COVID-19 pandemic.

            <p class="sectionSubTag small-text">Fresh Little Minds ‘Lets GROW Together’ programme is a targeted early
                intervention programme tier 2–3 intervention for carers/parents and child/ren to undertake together.
                This intervention has been successful in supporting and deescalating the stresses experienced by many
                families on waiting lists for CAMHS & ASD services. Parents/carers are empowered to become proactive in
                supporting their own children’s emotional wellbeing and coping strategies. Results have included a
                reduction in overwhelm, more empowered parents, and a clinical prediction for reduced risk for mental
                disorders including depression, anxiety, concentration disorder and ASD.
                This initiative aims to improve the health and wellbeing of parents & children through nurturing
                resilience.
                The programme will build resilience amongst children and their carers and supports families develop
                skills and knowledge in these areas:
